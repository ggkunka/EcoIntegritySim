# EcoIntegritySim

**EcoIntegritySim** is a simulation platform designed to ensure the integrity of environmental data using a combination of federated learning and blockchain technology. The project leverages AI-based anomaly detection and tamper-proof logging on a distributed ledger, making it suitable for environments requiring data redundancy and security.

## Features

- **Federated Learning:** Distributed machine learning model training without centralizing data.
- **Blockchain Integration:** Immutable logging of detected anomalies for traceability and security.
- **AI-based Anomaly Detection:** Detection of data anomalies using autoencoders.
- **Multi-agent System:** Implements a collaborative approach for model training and anomaly logging.

```

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, make sure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v16.20.2)
- **Ganache CLI** (Blockchain simulation)
- **Truffle** (For deploying smart contracts)
- **Python** (Version 3.12 or later)
- **Conda** (To manage virtual environments)
- **TensorFlow** (For machine learning)

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ggkunka/EcoIntegritySim.git
   cd EcoIntegritySim
   ```

2. **Set up the environment:**

   Create and activate the conda environment:

   ```bash
   conda create -n fresh-env python=3.12
   conda activate fresh-env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   npm install -g ganache-cli
   npm install -g truffle
   ```

4. **Compile and migrate the smart contracts:**

   Navigate to the `eco-integrity-contract` directory and deploy the contract to the local blockchain:

   ```bash
   cd eco-integrity-contract
   truffle migrate --network development
   ```

## Usage

### 1. **Running the Blockchain Automation Script**

You can automate the process of starting the blockchain and federated learning by using the `run_blockchain_automation.sh` script:

```bash
./run_blockchain_automation.sh
```

This script:
- Starts Ganache CLI.
- Deploys the smart contracts.
- Initiates the federated learning process.
- Runs anomaly detection and logs detected anomalies to the blockchain.

### 2. **Running Federated Learning Simulation**

To manually run the federated learning simulation:

```bash
python federated_learning_simulation.py
```

### 3. **Running the IDS (Anomaly Detection System)**

To run the anomaly detection system using the ToNIoT dataset:

```bash
python ids.py
```

This will train an autoencoder on the dataset and log any detected anomalies to the blockchain.

## Project Goals

This project aims to:
1. **Ensure Data Integrity:** Provide a robust system for maintaining the integrity of environmental data using blockchain.
2. **Enhance Anomaly Detection:** Use AI-driven techniques to detect anomalies in environmental datasets.
3. **Secure Logging:** Implement tamper-proof logging of anomaly detection events using smart contracts on a blockchain.
